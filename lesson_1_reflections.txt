How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

the diff function alowed me to pinpoint the places where the file had changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you made an error along the way you can always go back to a previous version and start from the point where the project was fine.
