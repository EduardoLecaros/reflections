What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a new folder called .git, this folder would be used to store metainformation about the changes in the current folder. you nit to do this so git knows you want it to start a version control in that expecifit folder

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a middle ground between the two, the repository is where the already commits are being store and the working directory is where all of the files that you are working are stored. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?


well, you can us "git add" every time you make some improvement until you know that is time to make a commit
